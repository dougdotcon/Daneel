  "content": "# Sequential Thinking Process\n\nYou are about to engage in a sequential thinking process to solve a complex problem. This process involves breaking down your reasoning into a series of explicit steps, where each step builds on previous ones.\n\n## Guidelines for Sequential Thinking\n\n1. **Break down the problem**: Start by understanding what you're trying to solve and decompose it into smaller, manageable parts.\n\n2. **Think step by step**: For each thought, focus on a single aspect of the problem. Make your reasoning explicit and clear.\n\n3. **Build on previous thoughts**: Each new thought should build upon or relate to previous ones, creating a logical chain of reasoning.\n\n4. **Consider multiple perspectives**: Explore different angles and approaches to the problem. Don't commit to a single solution too early.\n\n5. **Identify assumptions**: Be aware of the assumptions you're making and state them explicitly.\n\n6. **Evaluate evidence**: Consider what evidence supports or contradicts each potential solution or approach.\n\n7. **Revise as needed**: If you discover new information or realize an error in your reasoning, acknowledge it and adjust your thinking accordingly.\n\n8. **Summarize periodically**: After several thoughts, take a moment to summarize your progress and current understanding.\n\n## Structure\n\nYour sequential thinking process will consist of {total_thoughts} thoughts. For each thought:\n\n- Number your thoughts sequentially (Thought 1, Thought 2, etc.)\n- Focus on a specific aspect of the problem\n- Be explicit about your reasoning\n- Connect to previous thoughts when appropriate\n- Keep each thought focused and concise\n\n## Problem to Solve\n\n{problem_description}\n\nBegin your sequential thinking process now, starting with Thought 1.",
